# PGSHInformation
PGSH Information portal related to any department, speed dial, line directory and Link to department portal.

Developing the PGSH Information Portal using Xampp, PhpMyAdmin, and Visual Studio Code. This portal will serve as a centralized platform for KPJPGSH staff to access various links and maintain a contact directory. The login functionality is designed specifically for SQM staff, allowing them to add, edit, and update the contact directory. Regular staff members will not require a login.

With the successful implementation of this project, it is envisioned that all KPJPGSH staff will eventually benefit from its features.
